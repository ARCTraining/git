subtitle: "Create and edit some files"

Let's test out using `git` in our Codespaces virtual machine!

Follow along as we create some files, make some edits, and `add` and `commit` them to our *repository*!

## Our git workflow

Remember our git cycle:

- We create/modify/edit files
- We **add** our changes (once, twice, many times) (`git add <filename>`)
- We **commit** our bundle of changes (`git commit -m "message here"`)
- We repeat this cycle!

## git hints

- Create and edit files and folders
- Run `git status` to check what changes you've made and to see the *state* of the files
- Run `git add filename` to add the changes in a file
    - You can add files in sub-folders too: `git add sub-folder/filename`
    - You can also add multiple files: `git add filename1 filename2 subfolder/filename3`
- Run `git status` to check the *state* of the files
- Commit your bundle of files with a short message with `git commit -m "message goes here"`
- You can also just run `git commit` and a text editor will open for you to write a commit message
- Run `git status` to check the *state* of the files
