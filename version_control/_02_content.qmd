## What does `git` do?

- `git` allows you to bundle up changes to various files, and give the group of changes a unique [commit hash]{.extra} and an explanatory message.
- `git` works on a project level, so you can make a bunch of changes to different files in a folder, and then [commit]{.extra} all those changes with a descriptive message
- It's recorded that *you* made those changes, and there's a unique [commit hash]{.extra} that you can quote to point at the exact state of your folder when you added those changes.

## What does `git` do?

- `git` is a command line program
- There are actually only a few commands you'll really use regularly
- But before we move on to learning what commands are needed, let's try to build a [mental model]{.extra} of `git`
- Hopefully this will be useful to those of you who are already using `git` too!

- When we work with `git`, we bundle up changes in our project folder (/directory) and [commit]{.extra} our changes.
- Each [commit]{.extra} (bundle of changes) gets a unique [id]{.extra} - a hexadecimal hash that's 40 digits long (we're just going to abbreviate to the first 7)
- The [commits]{.extra} are made to a "branch"

## The `git` cycle {.smaller}

So we've looked at the idea of bundling up changes as [commits]{.extra}, but what does that actually involve?

I think of it like packing a picnic basket:

:::: {.box-ly}

::: {.incremental}
1. I make a sandwich and wrap it up
2. I add it to the basket
3. I chop up some fruit and put it in a lunchbox
4. I add *that* to the basket
5. I make a smoothie and bottle it
6. I add *that* to the basket too
7. Finally, I close over the top of the picnic basket and secure the latch
:::

How does this have anything to do with `git`?

:::: {.box-ly}
1. I make a sandwich and wrap it up
2. I add it to the basket
3. I chop up some fruit and put it in a lunchbox
4. I add *that* to the basket
5. I make a smoothie and bottle it
6. I add *that* to the basket too
7. Finally, I close over the top of the picnic basket and secure the latch
::::

## The `git` cycle {.smaller}

Let's introduce the concept of `add` as well as `commit`.

:::: {.box-ly}
1. I make a sandwich and wrap it up -> **I make some edits to files/create new files in my project folder**
2. I add it to the basket -> **I `add` my changes**
3. I chop up some fruit and put it in a lunchbox -> **I make some more edits to files**
4. I add *that* to the basket  -> **I `add` my changes**
5. I make a smoothie and bottle it -> **I make some more edits to files**
6. I add *that* to the basket too -> **I `add` my changes**
7. I close over the top of the picnic basket and secure the latch -> **I `commit` all these changes that I previously `added`**
::::

## The `git` cycle

Let's introduce the concept of `add` as well as `commit`.

:::{.incremental}
- You create or edit files, *then*
- You `add` those changes, *then*
- You either create/edit more files and repeat `add` *or* you `commit` all the added changes with a little message
:::

:::: {.box-lp}
I think of `git add` as like a quick save, whereas `git commit` is a full, proper save.

```
:::
:::::

::: {.column width="60%"}

- [Untracked/modified]{.extra}: files that have been created or edited since the last cycle, that haven't been **added** or **committed**
- [Staged]{.extra}: files that have been **added** (put in the basket) but **not committed** yet.
- [Committed]{.extra}: files that have been **added and committed** and now have a unique id attached to their most recent changes (and have not been edited since the last commit)

As well as being able to "undo" entire commits, you can undo different stages of this cycle (e.g. you can *unstage* files so they go from being [staged]{.extra} to [untracked]{.extra})
