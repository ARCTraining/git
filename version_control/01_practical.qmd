## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

If you don't already have a GitHub account:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **"Sign up"** in the top right corner
3. Enter your email address, create a password, and choose a username
4. Complete the verification process
5. Choose the free plan when prompted

## Step 2: Create Your First Repository

1. **Sign in to GitHub** and navigate to your dashboard
2. **Click the green "New" button** or the **"+"** icon in the top right corner and select **"New repository"**

3. **Fill in repository details:**
   - **Repository name**: Choose a descriptive name (e.g., `my-first-repo`)
   - **Description**: Add a brief description (optional but recommended)
   - **Visibility**: Keep it **Public** for this exercise
   - **âœ… Check "Add a README file"** - this creates an initial file in your repository
   - Leave other options as default

## Step 3: Launch Your Repository in Codespaces

2. **Click the green "Code" button**
3. **Select the "Codespaces" tab**
4. **Click "Create codespace on main"**

## What just happened?

You've created:

- A **repository** - your project folder on GitHub
- A **Codespace** - a virtual development environment connected to your repository
- Your first **README.md** file - which serves as the front page of your repository

Your Codespace includes a code editor, terminal, and all the tools needed for development, including `git`!

## Next Steps

Once your Codespace is running, you're ready to start learning git commands in the next practical session.
