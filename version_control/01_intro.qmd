In today's session, we will jump between learning about version control conceptually, and testing out some basic git tasks on our computers.

The aim of today is:

- To help you build a "mental model" of what git is and how it works
- Get you familiar with the basic git workflow

The aim of this session is:

- To highlight the usefulness of version control in research
- To get you set up with a GitHub account and on GitHub codespaces

## Reveal.js Presentation Controls

The presentation linked below uses Reveal.js to build a HTML presentation. You can use the following keyboard shortcuts:

- **Navigate slides**: Use arrow keys (←/→) or space bar to advance
- **Overview mode**: Press `O` to see all slides at once
- **Speaker notes**: Press `S` to open speaker view  
- **Help menu**: Press `?` to see all keyboard shortcuts
- **Fullscreen**: Press `F` to toggle fullscreen mode
- **Zoom**: Press `Alt` + click to zoom in on slide content
- **Print/PDF**: Add `?print-pdf` to the URL for print-friendly version

You can also scroll down to see the presentation content printed all-in-one page below. Note that the content is written for a presentation as opposed to article, and designed for the presentation light theme, so some points may be repeated and not optimised for the dark theme!
