subtitle: "Branching, merging, and pull requests"

In this practical, you'll create a new branch, make some changes, and then merge those changes back using GitHub's web interface.

## Our branching workflow

Remember the branching process:

- We create a new `branch` from main (`git branch <branch-name>`)
- We `switch` to our new branch (`git checkout <branch-name>` or `git switch <branch-name>`)
- We make changes, `add`, and `commit` as usual
- We *`push` our branch to GitHub (`git push origin <branch-name>`)
- We create a `pull request` on GitHub to merge our changes
- We `merge` the pull request and `delete` the branch

## Step 1: Create and switch to a new branch

1. **Check your current branch** and status:
   ```bash
   git status
   git branch
   ```

2. **Create a new branch** called `feature-bio`:
   ```bash
   git branch feature-bio
   ```

3. **Switch to your new branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-bio
   ```
   
   *Or use the newer syntax:*
   ```bash
   git switch feature-bio
   ```

4. **Verify you're on the new branch**:
   ```bash
   git branch
   ```
   *You should see an asterisk (*) next to `feature-bio`*

## Shortcut!
You can create and switch to a new branch in one command:
`git checkout -b feature-bio` or `git switch -c feature-bio`
:::

## Step 2: Make changes on your branch

1. **Create a new file** called `about.md`:
   ```bash
   touch about.md
   ```

2. **Edit the file** and add some content about yourself:
   ```markdown
   # About Me
   
   ## Bio
   Write a few sentences about yourself here.
   
   ## Research Interests
   - List your research areas
   - Or hobbies if you prefer!
   
   ## Fun Fact
   Share something interesting about yourself.
   ```

3. **Add and commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add about.md
   git commit -m "Add personal bio page"
   ```

## Step 3: Push your branch to GitHub

1. **Push your branch** to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-bio
   ```

2. **Check the output** - git will give you a link to create a pull request!

## Step 4: Create a pull request on GitHub

1. **Go to your repository** on GitHub in your browser
2. **You should see a yellow banner** saying "Compare & pull request" - click it!
   
   *If you don't see it:*
   - Click the **"Branch"** dropdown and select `feature-bio`
   - Click **"Contribute"** â†’ **"Open pull request"**

3. **Fill in the pull request details:**
   - **Title**: Something descriptive like "Add personal bio page"
   - **Description**: Explain what changes you made
   - **Review the changes** in the "Files changed" tab

4. **Click "Create pull request"**

## Step 5: Review and merge the pull request

1. **Review your pull request:**
   - Check the **"Files changed"** tab to see your modifications
   - Look at the **"Checks"** (if any are running)

2. **Merge the pull request:**
   - Click **"Merge pull request"**
   - Click **"Confirm merge"**
   - Optionally click **"Delete branch"** to clean up

## Step 6: Update your local repository

1. **Switch back to main branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. **Pull the latest changes**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. **Verify your changes** are now in main:
   ```bash
   ls
   cat about.md
   ```

4. **Clean up your local branch** (optional):
   ```bash
   git branch -d feature-bio
   ```

## git branch hints

- Use `git branch` to list all branches
- Use `git branch <name>` to create a new branch
- Use `git checkout <name>` or `git switch <name>` to switch branches
- Use `git push origin <branch-name>` to push a branch to GitHub
- Always create pull requests for important changes - even when working alone!
- Pull requests provide a record of what changed and why

## Challenge: Try it again!

Create another branch, make different changes (maybe edit your README.md), and go through the pull request process again!
